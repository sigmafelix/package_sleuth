# package_sleuth
*R spatial packages reproducibility/functionality check*
- I will update code blocks for testing some issues regarding well-known or published geospatial packages, preferably in a fully reproducible way.
- All issues reproduced here will be uploaded and maintained only if there is no way to raise issues via GitHub or other Git-related repositories, otherwise I will raise the issue(s) directly to the package maintainer.
